		<h1>Why do I get up every mornging</h1>
		<p>
			To live a valuable and a rewarding life by showing <b>love</b> to God Jehovah, myself, and other people. To{' '}
			<b>improve myself</b> so that I'm more useful, more powerful, and <b>freer</b> person, putting myself in the
			best position possible to <b>give value</b> and practical help to other people.
		</p>
		<h2>What do I do the whole day?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Help people have a better job</b>. Since February 2017 I took part in the recruitment of over 30
				people at @Netguru.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Make people better React developers.</b> I mentor new hires and regularly share knowledge about
				front-end development during company-wide meetings.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Improve the quality of software</b> created at @Netguru. While developing a solution, I reflect on
				how it will influence conversion rates, revenue, and user experience. What parts of software development
				are my favorite ones? Those that benefit my team the most - writing tests and doing/receiving a code
				review.️
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Contribute to Open-Source.</b> I have a great amount of respect for people who maintain open-source
				libraries. Thus, I regularly seek possibilities to contribute.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Strive to be a husband my wife deserves.</b> She says I’m doing quite well with this one 😉
			</li>
			<li>Well, I do a bunch of other stuff. You can ask me about it over a 🍺 or two.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Where can you find me?</h2>
